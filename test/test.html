    <!-- There are some awkward cross-dependencies here, nodeunit uses async
         internally and the browser version of async will be added to the
         global namespace. Because of this we only include nodeunit and it
         runs tests against the async lib bundled with that. If you make
         changes to async.js and want to test them you must also make a new
         nodeunit build for now...
